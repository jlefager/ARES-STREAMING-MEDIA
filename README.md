Ares - Streming Media Form
=================

About
-----------------

DePaul University added customizations to the Ares Course Reserves System from Atlas in order to enable embedding streaming media within the course reserves system.  

This was enabled based on DePaul's own needs, but can be applied elsewhere.

By using the textpad component of Ares of text files, staff and faculty can add embed code within the Ares Web interface that when viewed from the student view will display a media widget.  This combined two different form options within Ares, Articles and Text Files, along with jQuery to create one form where instructors could request to have an entire item digitized or a portion of an item.  This can be repurposed to display embedded media directly, such as Alexander Street media or streaming media


Installation
----------------

Add the two files to your Ares web docs folder and add a link within IRFMENU.html
